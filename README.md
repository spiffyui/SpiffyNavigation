[Spiffy UI](http://www.spiffyui.org) - GWT made simple
==================================================

This application is a sample of Spiffy UI navigation using the [Spiffy UI navigation widgets](http://www.spiffyui.org/javadoc/org/spiffyui/client/nav/package-summary.html).  It builds a simple application with three panels and a navigation item sub group which works like the navigation bar on [SpiffyUI.org](http://www.spiffyui.org).

This project is built with [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/).  
    
Go to your project's root directory and run the following command:

    mvn package jetty:run
