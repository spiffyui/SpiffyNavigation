<!-- This is the template file for the main application page.  The first 
     step here is to add some elements with special IDs we'll bind to later.
     Each on of these elements will get a dynamic control added to it in

        This example shows you how to change the standard <i>Hello Spiffy</i> application and build a basic <a href="http://www.spiffyui.org/javadoc/org/spiffyui/client/nav/package-summary.html">Spiffy UI navigation widget</a> and manage panels in a Spiffy UI application.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Spiffy UI navigation panels are very flexible.  They can contain <a href="http://www.spiffyui.org/javadoc/org/spiffyui/client/nav/NavHeader.html">headers</a>, <a href="http://www.spiffyui.org/javadoc/org/spiffyui/client/nav/NavItem.html">items</a>, <a href="http://www.spiffyui.org/javadoc/org/spiffyui/client/nav/NavPanel.html">complex panels</a>, <a href="http://www.spiffyui.org/javadoc/org/spiffyui/client/nav/NavSection.html">sub-sections</a>, and <a href="http://www.spiffyui.org/javadoc/org/spiffyui/client/nav/NavSeparator.html">separators</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Navigation panels use CSS for layout.  You can change the colors, fonts, and even the layout with simple changes to the CSS.  The <a href="http://www.spiffyui.org/?css">SpiffyUI.org CSS panel</a> shows you an example of the navigation bar as a tab panel.
